# ### ABOUT

# Starts the "sensors" utility in an instance of Konsole (terminal emulator) with
# its window positioned in the top right corner of the (main) screen with the defined
# dimensions and keeping the window above others.

# IMPORTANT:
# - You need to disable "Remember window size" in the Konsole (terminal
# emulator). Following on Konsole "Settings" -> "Configure Konsole...".
# - Install "wmctrl" and xdotool utilities.
